Job description file for filtering vcf

TEMPLATE v1

=========== Data location and analysis settings =============

Data server: admin@mgqnap.medschl.cam.ac.uk
Project location: /share/alexey

project: project1
raw variantset name: variantset1
filter name: filter1

Min SNP DP: 5000.0
Min SNP QUAL: 150.0
Min SNP VQSLOD: 12.3456
SNP TS: 97.0

Min INDEL DP: 5000.0
Min INDEL QUAL: 150.0
Min INDEL VQSLOD: 1.2345
INDEL TS: 95.0

Notes: 
- DP refers to total depth over all samples (e.g. use num of samples * 10)
- QUAL threshold may be selected on the basis of Ti/Tv ratio in vcfstats
- DP and QUAL thresholds may be set equally for for SNPs and INDELs
- TS and VQSLOD for SNPs and INDELs should be taken from the appropriate tranches files 
- VQSLOD is used for actual filtration; TS is merely placed into the filter's label: it is NOT used in any calculations!
- Keep at least one digit after decimal point in the thresholds

Note about using different R versions
-------------------------------------
R-3.2.0 is used here for plotting in GATK-VQSR, 
which requires a specific set of R-libraries.
For being accessable by GATK, R-3.2.0 is added to PATH.
  
R-3.2.2 is used here to genereate html and pdf reports with rmarkdown.
Generating reports with Rmarkdown is pernickety about environment. 
It requires recent versions of several system libraries
and a number of additional R libraries to be pre-installed.
The external libraries are loaded as modules in *.sb.sh script:
module load gcc/5.2.0
module load boost/1.50.0
module load texlive/2015
module load pandoc/1.15.2.1
Rmarkdown library has to be installed in the r_lib_folder
shown above. 

Historically, at the time of the scripts preparation, it happened
that different sets of libraries were available in different versions
of R installed in the toolbox. This resulted to the temporary configuration
of using two different R versions at the same time. Then, there was 
no time and need to change it.  

See details details about required R-libraries in the 
r-installation notes in the tools folder.
