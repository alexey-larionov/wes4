Note about using different R versions
-------------------------------------
R-3.2.0 is used here for plotting in GATK-VQSR, 
which requires a specific set of R-libraries.
For being accessable by GATK, R-3.2.0 is added to PATH.
  
R-3.2.2 is used here to genereate html and pdf reports with rmarkdown.
Generating reports with Rmarkdown is pernickety about environment. 
It requires recent versions of several system libraries
and a number of additional R libraries to be pre-installed.
The external libraries are loaded as modules in *.sb.sh script:
module load gcc/5.2.0
module load boost/1.50.0
module load texlive/2015
module load pandoc/1.15.2.1
Rmarkdown library has to be installed in the r_lib_folder
shown above. 

Historically, at the time of the scripts preparation, it happened
that different sets of libraries were available in different versions
of R installed in the toolbox. This resulted to the temporary configuration
of using two different R versions at the same time. Then, there was 
no time and need to change it.  

See details details about required R-libraries in the 
r-installation notes in the tools folder.
